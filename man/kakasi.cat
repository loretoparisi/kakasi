       _K_A_K_A_S_I In Japanese sentences are often made up  a  mixture
       of   Chinese   characters   (Kanji),  Kana  (Hiragana  and
       Katakana) and  Romaji  (Latin  phonetical  pronunciation).
       This program converts between these four different ways of
       writing Japanese.

       This program is useful for those whose terminal or desktop
       does  not  support  the  native display of Japanese.  Also
       this is a great tool for those who are  learning  Japanese
       (international students and children etc).

       A word can be passed into the standard input (stdin), then
       it is translated and output to standard out (stdout).   In
       the following example the "bunchu" Kanji is converted into
       Hiragana.


                 kakasi -JH < document

       Since version 2.3.0 text with spaces in-between words  has
       been  supported.   In the following example the output has
       spaces in-between each word.

                 kakasi -w < document

       Since version 2.3.5 level conversion mode  has  been  sup-
       ported.   In the following example, simple Kanjis are left
       them unconverted, and difficult Kanjis are translated into
       Hiragana.

                 kakasi -l4 < document

       _K_A_K_A_S_I  It  is possible to convert letters to alphabetical
       characters.  Also Katakana letters in the JIS x0201  char-
       acter  set and the Hiragana in the JIS x0208 character set
       can be converted between each other.

       _K_A_K_A_S_I The following character set in  brackets  which  is
       displayed.


       ASCII (a) Known as "ascii" character set.


       JISROMAN (j)
                 Known as "jis roman" character set.


       GRAPHIC (g)
                 It is the DEC graphic character set.


       Katakana (k)
                 JIS  x0201,  defined as part of the GR character
                 set.


                 As a matter of convinience, JIS x0208 is divided
                 as stated below.


       Kanji (J)
                 JIS  x0208 characters included between 16 and 94
                 sections.

       Hiragana (H)
                 JIS  x0208  characters  included  in  section  4
                 (Hiragana)

       Katakana (K)
                 JIS  x0208  characters  included  in  section  5
                 (Katakana)

       Sign (E)
                 JIS  x0208  characters   included   in   section
                 1,2,3,6,7,  and  8.  (Note that section 9-15 are
                 undefined in JIS x0208.)

       Translation  between  the  following  character  sets  are
       available.


       ASCII        -> JISROMAN, Sign

       JISROMAN     -> ASCII, Sign

       GRAPHIC      -> ASCII, JISROMAN, Sign

       JISx0201 Katakana
                    -> ASCII, JISROMAN, Kana, Hiragana

       Sign         -> ASCII, JISROMAN

       Katakana     ->  ASCII, JISROMAN, JISx0201 Katakana, Hira-
                    gana

       Hiragana     -> ASCII, JISROMAN, JISx0201 Katakana, Kana

       Kanji        -> ASCII, JISROMAN, JISx0201 Katakana,  Kana,
                    Hiragana

       With conversion of ASCII and the JISROMAN the alphabetical
       character  conversion  is  done  from  JISx0201  Katakana,
       Katakana, Hiragana and Kanji.


       Example:

           1. All kanji characters are converted to Hiragana.

               kakasi -JH

           2.  All  JIS  x0208  characters are converted to JIS X
           0201.


               kakasi -Hk -Kk -Jk -Ea

           3. All characters are converted to JIS X 0208.

               kakasi -aE -jE -gE -kK

           4. All characters are converted to ascii and words are
           separated.

               kakasi -Ha -Ka -Ja -Ea -ka

           5.  Exchange between Katakana and Hiragana characters.

               kakasi -HK -KH

       Some character sets are categorized by  kakasi  and  indi-
       cated by following mnemonics: a, j, g, k, E, H, K, J.

             a --- ASCII characters
             j --- JIS ROMAN ( nearly equal to ASCII, "~" and "
                   different ) defined by JIS x0201
             g --- DEC Graphic Characters
             k --- KATAKANA defined by JIS x0201

       E, H, K, and J are included in JIS x0208 character set.

             J --- KANJI characters of JIS x0208.
             H --- HIRAGANA characters of JIS x0208.
             K --- KATAKANA characters of JIS x0208.
             E  ---  Rest  of above characters of JIS x0208 which
       includes
                   alphabets, numbers, symbols and so on.

       -(from)(to) means conversion from character set (from)  to
       (to).  For example, -JK option causes KANJI characters are
       converted to HIRAGANA. Combinations in the following table
       are  available.  (You must not remember it, because the -h
       shows same information)

             toom|    a    j    k    E    H     K    J    g

                K   |              o         o     -

             o  -- converted.
             1  -- converted to Romaji.
             2  -- Kanji -> Kana conversion.

       Unfortunately,  several  coding  systems are used in Japan
       and JIS x0208 standard are  changed  at  1983.  Therefore,
       KAKASI can automatically distinguish the coding system and
       coding revision and then use the same output coding system
       if  the  document does not include JIS x0201 KATAKANA.  If
       JIS x0201 KATAKANA is included or you wish to change kanji
       coding system, you may use the next options.

             -i : input coding

             euc,dec  --  Often  used  in  UNIX  like  computers.
       JISx0208 is
                    assigned  to  GR ( MSB is 1 ). The major dif-
       ference between
                    euc  and  dec  is  assignment   of   JISx0201
       KATAKANA and
                    the DEC graphic character.

       There  are  2  types  of Romaji writing.  The first is the
       Kunrei method defined by Japanese government, and the sec-
       ond  is the Hepburn method.  I think Hepburn method sounds
       naturally to foreigners.

             -rhepburn : Hepburn Method (default)

             -p: List all possible readings. If there  exist  two
       or more
                 possible  readings,  KAKASI shows them in braces
       {aaa,bbb}.
             -s: Insert a separate character between words.
             -f: Furigana mode. Shows  the  original  kanji  word
       with reading.
             -c: Skip characters within word. ( default TAB CR LF
       BLANK )

       _K_A_K_A_S_I can accept additional dictionary to the system dic-
       tionary.  The acceptable format of  additional  dictionary
       is  _S_K_K  format,  and _W_n_n format, and so on.  Namely, each
       record is one line with two  fields,  Yomi  (reading)  and
       Jukugo(idiom).   Fields are separated with commas (or TAB,
       or blank).  The kanji code is restricted to  JIS  or  EUC.
